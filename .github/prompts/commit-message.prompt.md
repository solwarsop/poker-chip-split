description: Generate a commit message based on the changes made in the codebase.
---
Provide a suggested commit message in markdown that describes the changes made. If both staged and unstaged changes are present, describe *ignore any unstaged changes*. Only describe staged changes. The commit message should be concise and follow the format: `feat: <description>` for new features, `fix: <description>` for bug fixes, or `docs: <description>` for documentation updates. As well as describing the change, make sure to also mention the objects involved in the change. Make sure to wrap any object names or code snippets in the commit message with backticks (``).
